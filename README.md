# Intel_Galileo_auto_irrigation

This is a project on Intel Galileo Gen2 board(arduino based).
For crops which require flood irrigation mechanism(e.g. paddy),
this system helps keep track of whether water is at the optimum level(known from beforehand).
Once the optimum water level reaches optimum, the LED turns red and buzzer emits sound.
Otherwise, the LED will be green.

Here we used a

1. rain sensor(HL83)
2. Comparator(LM393)
2. RGB LED
3. BUZZER(TMB12A05)
4. connecting wires
5. Arduino SDK
6. Bread Board
7. Resistors
